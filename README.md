*Exercice realized from 1st april 2019 to 5 april 2019, as a group project for the formation [BeCode](https://www.becode.org/) to be a Web Developper*

## Project

For this project, we have to realize a weather forecast web application using Figma, VueJS and the API openweathermap.
We added a bonus to this project. When you search the weather for a second location, the results get animated (using GSAP).
